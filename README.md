About
=====

The Highly Efficient FFT for Exascale (HeFFTe) library is being developed as part of the Exascale
Computing Project (ECP), which is a joint project of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of
Science and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). HeFFTe delivers algorithms for
distributed fast-Fourier transforms in on a heterogeneous systems, targeting the upcoming exascale machines.
